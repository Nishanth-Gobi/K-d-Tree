## Nearest Neighbor(s) Search using K-d Tree 

The program works on the concept of recursive space partitioning.  </br>

When a set of points in k-dimensional space is given as input, the nearest neighbour(s) of a user given point is(are) found by recursively partitioning the space around the point and choosing the closest partition.      </br>

The program also has functions for basic K-d Tress operations (Insertion, deletion, search and display) along with pre-fed data for the K-d tree to help showcase the use of various functions
</br>
##### Useful additions: </br>
-> The program currently works only for values of integer data type </br>
-> Implementing a functuion for Range Search
